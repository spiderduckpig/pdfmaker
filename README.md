This is a free tool to convert, clarify, compress, and combine images of homework assignments (handwritten work) in jpgs or pngs into a single pdf file. It does adaptive thresholding to make sure that the image is readable even if you are using a soft (number 2 or above) pencil. 


Instructions: put images (jpg or png) in alphabetical order in the input folder. Then run process.py and then run topdf.py. Then the final pdf will be put in the Final folder. If you want to clear the directories to add new files run clear.py.
